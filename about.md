# Hello!

I'm Nek. Aka Maxime Veber. And also a backend developer that like to play with all that touch computing. Basically it means that I code un PHP/Symfony but I also do TypeScript and Kernel modules. As well as server configuration.

I'm a frenchy guy but I can also speak english. I love watching pro gamers playing LeagueOfLegends, and I also like losing against other noobs on LeagueOfLegends. Sometimes I play piano, sometimes I go to the gym.

That's basically all about my life. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
