Woketo is a library to make PHP understand WebSockets. It's a direct concurrent to [Ratchet](https://github.com/ratchetphp/Ratchet) and Amphp. It's performing and pass the test suite of Autobahn (which means it's ready for production).

A lot of work from me. Feel free to use. It's open source and maintained.
