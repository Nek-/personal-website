[Woketo](https://github.com/Nekland/Woketo) is a library to make PHP understand [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API). It's a direct concurrent to [Ratchet](https://github.com/ratchetphp/Ratchet) and [Amphp](https://github.com/amphp/websocket-server). It's performing and pass the test suite of Autobahn (which means it's ready for production).

A lot of work from me. Feel free to use. It's free, open source and maintained.
